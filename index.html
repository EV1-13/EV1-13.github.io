      <p><u>Reflection</u></p>
      <p>I was interested in this CodePen because I really liked the visuals of it. I am more into the visual side of programming, and the colors of this code looked pretty cool. It would be a good loading screen element for a website, especially since the colors were easy to tweak.
        <br> I ended up only changing the colors for this code, because the rest of the code was too complicated for me to understand quite yet. I was able to figure out how hsl colors work, though, after looking up with what it stood for. 
        After that I was able to change the values in order to make my own colors, choosing more cool colors rather then the RGB colors that were in the original program. While looking through the code, I also noticed there were a lot of syntax that included the word "translate." 
        I'm assuming that is what makes the circles move around on the screen, since the word translate can mean something along the lines of "move" as well. Changing the color was pretty easy, but I hope to change something a little more impactful next time I see a cool CodePen I want to take a look at, once I get more and more familiar with the languages involved.
